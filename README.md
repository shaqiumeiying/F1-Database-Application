# A database application in the domain of Formula 1 (F1)

- Modelling based on the aspects of F1, including races (specifically arranged for F1), circuits (the location where a race takes place), constructors (i.e. the racing teams), team members (i.e. racing drivers and team principles) and cars (e.g. racing cars and the safety car). Moreover, additional information such as F1 official staff, sponsors and broadcasters will also be applied for user query search. 

- This project is done using the CS departmentâ€™s Oracle database system and PHP.
